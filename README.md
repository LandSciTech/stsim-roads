# stsim-roads
This is an add-on package to SyncroSim (https://syncrosim.com/) for simulating the development of road networks associated with harvest or other disturbances in state-and-transtion landcover change models. The code is in development, and may or may not work. The road network simulation methods are being implemented in an R package for general use: https://github.com/LandSciTech/roads. This is simply a wrapper for integrating the R package methods into the SyncroSim modelling framework. Contact josie.hughes@canada.ca with questions.
